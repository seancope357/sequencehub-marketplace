## If Still Seeing White Screen

The dev server may need a **manual restart from your interface**:

1. Look for a "Restart" or "Reload" button
2. Check if there's a dev server control panel
3. The system should detect the cleared cache and rebuild automatically

The white screen is caused by a **turbopack cache corruption** that has now been cleared. Once the server rebuilds, everything will load correctly.
